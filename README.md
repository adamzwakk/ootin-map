# OOTin-map

Generating and creating a map/tracker for use in OOT Randomizer.

- Uses maps found on https://www.vgmaps.com/Atlas/N64/

Start by running `node tools/generate-map.js` to download the source maps and generate your map/map tiles. Then zoom around in your full OOT map!

TODO:

- Entrance marker popups let you add the location they lead to
- Import a spoilers json to show entrance/item placements on the map
- Route Finder, give it a start/destination and it'll give the best path
